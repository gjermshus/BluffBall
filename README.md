### The bookies make a living out of accurately predicting the future. BluffBall lets you turn their hard work into fantasy football points

BluffBall scrapes the latest odds online to calculate an expected points value for players in the fantasy premier league game (fantasy.premierleague.com). It uses these to recommend transfers to FPL players, and suggests optimised starting lineups. The odds used include:

  - Anytime goalscorer
  - To score 2 or more
  - To score 3 or more
  - To keep a clean sheet
  
In addition, BluffBall uses statistical modelling to predict how likely each player is to play more than 60 minutes in the next game (which in turn is used when calculating appearance and clean sheet points), and employs a basic past-performance method to estimate expected assist points.

Armed with this knowledge, BluffBall can automtically import a user's team and recommend their best starting 11, the best transfers they can make, and the best affordable dreamteam for the upcoming gameweek. Check out fantasyfootball.shinyapps.io/BluffBall to see it in action.
